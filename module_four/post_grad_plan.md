# Katie Keel: Post-Grad Action Plan


## #2: Supporting Others in Your Cohort in Their Job Search

As a member of the Turing community, your support in the job search makes a big difference for your peers as they pursue their first position. Complete the following action steps.

**Action Step #1:** Identify 1-2 people from your PD Peer Group who you will continue to check in with during the first 30 days post-graduation. Describe what you will do in these check-ins, how you will help keep them motivated, and how you will follow up with these cohortmates afterwards.

**JF Lalonde and David Becker** - I'll Slack DM them weekly to see how their job search is going, provide emotional support and strategy planning, and help with any housekeeping I can.

**Action Step #2:** With the person(s) you identified above, describe one area of the job search that you feel particularly skilled in and will commit to helping them with on a regular basis during the first 30 days. Examples include: review outreach emails, review blog posts, practice storytelling, attend meetups or other events with them, etc. Why do you feel that you can help in this area? What will your help look like?

**I'm pretty good at writing and reviewing cover letters and outreach emails/messages.** I used to be a contract grant writer, so I understand business writing a little more than the average person, and have already helped several students with their cover letters so far. Additionally, I spearheaded the cold outreach Gear Up we led in Module 4, so I'm comfortable with helping people reach out online.

**Action Step #3:** Utilize your networking experience in the job search to recommend 1-2 people whom you've met that others in your cohort would benefit from meeting as well. Describe how you will make the introductions for at least 1 person in your cohort and when you will execute this by. 

**I've already sent job opportunities** I've turned down (or failed at) to several people in my class.
